# College_Voting_System
This project is an **Online College Voting System** made using PHP and MySQL. It is designed to make the voting process simple, fast, and secure. Students can register, log in, and vote for their preferred candidates. Candidates can also register and be managed easily. The system has an admin panel where administrators can manage students, candidates, and the overall voting process. It uses a secure login system to prevent unauthorized access and ensures that each student can vote only once. The interface is user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use and helping to make elections more transparent and efficient.
